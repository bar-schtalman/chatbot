# Chatbot Backend Project

A Spring Boot backend project for a chatbot that supports small talk and provides answers on specific subjects like weather, movies, series, and translations. The chatbot uses API requests, web scraping, regex, JSON pattern matching, and Dialogflow for bot logic.

## Features

- **Small Talk**: Engage in casual conversations with the bot.
- **Weather Information**: Get current weather updates via API requests.
- **Movies and Series**: Retrieve information about movies and series.
- **Translation Services**: Translate text from English to Hebrew.
- **Dialogflow Integration**: Manages bot logic and responses.
- **Web Scraping and Regex**: Extracts data from web pages.
- **Swagger UI**: Integrated for API testing and exploration.

## Usage

- **API Testing**: Use the Swagger UI to interact with the APIs directly.  
  [Swagger UI](https://bar-chatbot.runmydocker-app.com/swagger-ui.html#!/bot-controller/)
  
- **Chat with the Bot**: Use the Dialogflow web demo to interact with the bot. User input from the web demo is mapped to API calls, returning the desired responses.
